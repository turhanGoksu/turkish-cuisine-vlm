> 🎓 **Academic Project:** This project was developed as a **Senior Design Project (Bitirme Projesi)** at **Fırat University, Department of Software Engineering**.

**turkish-cuisine-vlm** is a specialized Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to recognize traditional Turkish foods from images, estimate their nutritional values, and provide dietary advice.

Fine-tuned on **Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct** using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, this model bridges the gap between general AI and cultural gastronomy.

## 🛠️ Installation

To run the code locally or in Google Colab, install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turhanGoksu/turkish-cuisine-vlm.git
cd turkish-cuisine-vlm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Before training, raw images must be processed into a structured format.

**Step 1:** Place your images in folders named after the food (e.g., `images/manti`, `images/kebab`).

**Step 2:** Run `rename_images.py` to standardize filenames:
```bash
python data_preparation/rename_images.py
```

**Step 3:** Run `generate_dataset.py` to create the `turkish_food_dataset.csv` file:
```bash
python data_preparation/generate_dataset.py
```

### 2. Fine-Tuning (Training)

Open `Turkish_Cuisine_AI.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

- **Hardware:** Trained on NVIDIA A100 (40GB) / Compatible with T4 (16GB) using 4-bit quantization
- **Config:** Adjust `DATASET_PATH` and `OUTPUT_DIR` in the notebook
- **Run:** Execute the cells to start LoRA fine-tuning

### 3. Inference

You can use the trained model directly from Hugging Face without re-training:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, Qwen2VLProcessor
from peft import PeftModel
from PIL import Image

# Load Model
base_model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct", 
    device_map="auto", 
    torch_dtype="auto"
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "Turhan123/turkish-cuisine-vlm")
processor = Qwen2VLProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct")

# Inference
image = Image.open("path/to/kebab.jpg")
# ... (See notebook for full inference code)
```

## 📊 Methodology & Results

- **Base Model:** Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct
- **Technique:** Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with LoRA (Rank: 64, Alpha: 128)
- **Dataset:** Custom dataset containing 48 Turkish food categories
- **Results:** The model successfully distinguishes visually similar foods and provides context-aware health advice (e.g., "Contains high sugar, consume moderately")
